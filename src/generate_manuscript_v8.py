"""Generate PathOmicDRP manuscript v8 from v7.

Adds four new Results subsections, corresponding Methods subsections,
Discussion paragraphs, and references to Fig 10-11 + FigS19-S21 + Table 6-7.

New content (Genome Medicine-targeted strengthening):

  R1. SOTA benchmarking
      — PathomicFusion / MOLI / Super.FELT-lite retrained on identical TCGA-BRCA
        431 cohort, 5-fold CV, same 13-drug panel. Report mean per-drug PCC and
        narrative on where PathOmicDRP wins vs these published methods.

  R2. Clinical utility — decision-curve analysis
      — Net-benefit curves for Dox / Cyclo / Pacl / Doce with bootstrap CI on
        AUROC.  Demonstrates that the 4-modal embedding + LogReg head yields
        positive net benefit over 'treat-all' and 'treat-none' across clinically
        relevant threshold ranges, even at the small TCGA per-drug n.

  R3. Biological validation of top-attention genes
      — Per-drug gene importance via OOF |Pearson r| between expression and
        predicted IC50, union of top-50 per drug (255 genes).  Cross-referenced
        against DepMap CRISPR dependency (81 BRCA cell lines, 22Q4 release),
        TCGA-BRCA univariate Cox (OS), METABRIC Cox (OS).  Reports 11 genes
        significant in both TCGA and METABRIC with concordant direction,
        highlights XBP1 / BTG2 / SCUBE2 / FBP1 / XBP1 / CD79A / CCL19 as
        biologically interpretable.

  R4. CPTAC-BRCA partial external validation (3-modal)
      — 122 tumors, transcriptomic + genomic matched, proteomic MS-based (not
        RPPA — zeroed as modality dropout).  Reports ER+/ER- biomarker
        concordance for endocrine drugs, HER2+/- for lapatinib (underpowered),
        TNBC discordance flagged honestly.  Drug-drug Spearman correlation
        matrix between CPTAC and TCGA predictions: r=0.28, p=0.013.
