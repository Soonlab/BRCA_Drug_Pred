"""Generate manuscript v7 from v6.

Adds:
  1. New Results subsection: "Drug-level heterogeneity: when does cross-modal
     fusion help?" — reports per-drug winners in the fair PCA-256 comparison,
     identifies MOA patterns, and reframes heterogeneity as a scope statement
     rather than a weakness.
  2. Expanded defensive paragraph on 4-modal external-cohort infeasibility
     — surveys every major public BRCA cohort and concludes TCGA-BRCA is the
     unique resource that simultaneously provides mutation + mRNA + RPPA + WSI
     + drug-response information.
  3. Discussion passage connecting drug-level heterogeneity with prognostic
     (not therapeutic) clinical utility.

        "0.769, ΔAUC = −0.481) the simple linear PCA baseline was superior. This "

        "integrating somatic genotype (TP53, BRCA, DNA-repair mutations), transcriptional "
        "DNA-damage-response activation, proteomic phosphorylation cascades, and "
        "histological proliferation/immune features, precisely the regime in which "
